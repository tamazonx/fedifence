## Why does this list exist?
Service providers have a duty of care to their users, this list provides a way to block sources of hate and discrimination on the Fediverse.

## What if I need or want to monitor abuse for legal, acadmic or personal reasons?
There are valid reasons to observe users on these servers, but the broader population that is not participant in such observation may wish to be shielded from these sources. To observe these users do not use a FediFenced service provider.

## Who is on the blocklist?
Mastodon service providers that knowingly host and deliver content that is categorised as:

Racism or advocation of racism
Sexism or advocation of sexism
Discrimination against family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity
Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism
Hateful terms, symbols, imagery, and shorthand
False or misleading information that may cause or lead to harm
The optional Twitter list contains servers that mirror content and user accounts from Twitter users without permission or consent.

## How can I be removed from the lists? How can I add to these lists?
You cannot. These lists are bare minimum blocklists compiled by a dedicated team of long-time Mastodon administrators committed to a safe, hate-free Mastodon experience. These lists are considered essential and unassailable.
