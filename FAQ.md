## Why does this list exist?
Service providers have a duty of care to their users, this list provides a way to block sources of hate and discrimination on the Fediverse.

## Who is on the blocklist?
Mastodon or Fediverse service providers that knowingly host and deliver content that is categorised as:

- Racism or advocation of racism
- Sexism or advocation of sexism
- Discrimination against family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity
- Xenophobia and/or violent nationalism
- Hateful terms, symbols, imagery, and shorthand
- False or misleading information that may cause or lead to harm
- Malware, DDoS, or exploit code intended to disrupt the network

The optional Twitter list contains servers that mirror content and user accounts from Twitter users without permission or consent.

## What if I need or want to monitor abuse for legal, academic or personal reasons?
There are valid reasons to observe users on these servers, but the broader population that is not participant in such observation may wish to be shielded from these sources. To observe these users do not use a FediFenced service provider.

## Why not just let individual users make these choices?
Service providers generally establish terms of service and acceptable use policies. Given the federated nature of the Mastodon and Fediverse platforms, it can be onerous for each individual to stay abreast of the threat vectors, or they may be technologically incapable on undesiring of understanding the intricacies of researching and finding a valid blocklist, importing it to their account, and managing the list over time. Service providers that have a duty of care to their users are trusted to make these decisions for their registered users, as well as complying with local law in their jurisdiction.

## How can I be removed from the lists?
